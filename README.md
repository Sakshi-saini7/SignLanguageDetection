# Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying hand gestures corresponding to sign language alphabets using deep learning techniques. It aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and non-sign language users by converting hand signs into readable characters.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of people around the world rely on sign language for communication. However, many others do not understand it. This creates a major communication barrier. The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system that uses a deep learning model to automatically recognize sign language gestures and display the corresponding alphabet.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The solution uses image classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify hand gesture images representing alphabets in American Sign Language (ASL).

### Key Components:
- **Data Collection**: Pre-labeled hand gesture images (A-Z) used as input.
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model**: CNN model implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Prediction**: Real-time or static image-based gesture recognition.
- **Interface**: Simple command-line or GUI interface to display predictions.
